    <p><img class="pic" src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach-in-hawaii.png" alt="Photo of rocky ocean beach in Hawaii"><span id='opening'>Many great stories could be told about the group of young kids who lived in a secluded corner of Whistler around the street of Barnfield.</span> Sandwiched between Blueberry Hill and Alta Lake, this area was routinely terrorized by me and my friends. Some fun tales include us damming the creek underneath the road, or going out and doing donuts in the snow with my friend’s old Honda when we were 12.  However, if there’s one story I remember the most, it would have to be the time we allegedly broke a bus window. During the winter, us kids always built forts in the large snow banks and snow dumps that littered our neighborhood. On the day in question we had decided to build some snow forts along the side of the main road. They were located just before the loop where the local bus stopped and turned around. From this spot we were often tempted to throw snowballs at passing cars. Unfortunately for us though, quite a few people driving by would know our parents, so we didn't risk throwing snow at them.. Therefore, we decided to only throw snow at the bus. This meant that, every half hour, we would line up in our little forts hidden from the road, and chuck as many snowballs as possible at the passing bus. This process would repeat every half hour from morning until nightfall. By the time night did come around, only two of us were still out there manning the forts, my friend’s brother Nicky, and me.

    <p>At about 6:00, by which time it was pitch black out, Nickey and I decided to call it a night and head home. This was when we made our mistake. Right before we were leaving, Nicky decided to throw just one more snowball at a passing car. The darkness would, in theory, give us great cover to escape if that person got out of their car. We waited until we saw headlights, then Nicky grabbed a snowball and threw it at this car (A perfect strike right on the door I might add). Now, if this had been any random car driving down the road I probably wouldn't be telling this story. But we had just so happened to hit the car of the transit officer who had been sent to deal with the disturbance we had been making. The officier wheeled his car around the loop, pulled up along our snowbank, rolled down his window, and started yelling at us to come out. Meanwhile, we hid silently behind the snowbank. Eventually Nicky caved and popped his head above the snowbank, probably expecting me to do the same. However, being a good friend, I decided to make a run for it. I used the cover of the snow bank to run, undetected, to the next street corner. From there I ran as fast as I could, while wearing snow gear, back to my house. When I got home I, of course, thought that I had got away scot free; and for a few minutes it looked like I had. Then the phone rang.

    <p>As it turned out, I had, pretty obviously, not managed to get out of trouble. Nickey, whom I had abandoned, lived pretty much right next to the snowbank we were using, so making a run home didn’t really work for him. The phone call was from Nicky’s mother, who had been told by the officer to round up all the kids in the neighborhood who had thrown snow at the bus. My dad, after hearing this, practically dragged me down the street to their house. When we got there all my friends and their parents were waiting. The officer proceeded to inform us that we had broken a window on the bus earlier in the day (Most of us still don’t believe this). He also informed us that we would have to pay for the damages. The damages were supposedly in excess of seven hundred dollars. Looking back on it, this seems pretty cheap considering what we had, allegedly, broken. Although, to a group of pre-teens, who considered a couple hundred dollars the peak of personal wealth, this was quite a scary prospect. The officer left after telling us that leaving me and my friends to trod home with our disappointed parents. Over the next few days we kept worrying about when we would have to cough up our savings, wondering when the transit people would phone our parents or show up again. Gradually those days turned into weeks, which  turned into months, and eventually we forgot about ever having to pay any fine. Maybe the idea of a fine was just to scare us; to make sure we never threw snowballs at the bus again? Whatever it was, we never did have to pay any fine, and nowadays, most of my friends don’t even believe we broke a window. Whatever happened, I can tell you that was the last time I ever threw snowballs at vehicles.
